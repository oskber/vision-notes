A note-taking application using Google Cloud Vision API for text detection in images.

## How to try it out:
- Clone project
- Add a .env and .json-file including neccessary credentials for Google and auth, which you need to get from me (if not setting it up by yourself).

Then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev //visit localhost:3000
```
