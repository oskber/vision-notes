A note-taking application using Google Cloud Vision API for text detection in images. 

## How to try it out:
- Clone project
- Add a .env and .json-file including neccessary credentials for Google and auth, which you need to get from me (if not setting it up by yourself).

Then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev //visit localhost:3000
```

## Or
Visit https://vision-notes.vercel.app/

### Try taking a photo, or upload an image file containing some type of text. The text will be extracted and imported to the app, where you can save it as a note. 

## Can be downloaded as a PWA.
